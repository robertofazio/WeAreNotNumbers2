# Concept
Starting from the idea to tell the emotions expressed on some social networks, We Are Not Numbers II is an interactive kinetic installation that creates a connection with the user who is invited to create a visual pattern through an Android application placed alongside the installation. The texture created will be displayed in real time on 100 physical pixels represented by the servo motors installed on it, through a hardware and open source software. The composition of the pattern is a grid of 100 inclined wooden pieces of 45 ° or -45 °. Each user then compose different views and then will be posted each account facebook We Are Not Numbers in real time.
